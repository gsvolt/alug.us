        <h3 class="section-subtitle">The history of the DOM</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="section-desc">
          Soon after javascript was invented it was quickly understood that there needed to be a method to access
          elements on a webpage. Netscape and Internet Explorer (IE) 3.0 were locked in battle in the early browser
          wars, and each of them developed their own verson of the Document Object Model known later as "DOM Level 0" or
          the "Legacy DOM". The obvious problem that arose is that methods to access the DOM from javascript were
          different between platforms. In addition, both were lacking in much of the functionality we come to expect
          from the DOM today.

          To combat this eventual devolution into chaos the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
          developed a recommendation in late 1998. This was known as "DOM Level 1". The final recommendation by W3C was
          published in 2004. Development migrated to the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
          Here was their recommended standard for the DOM.
        </p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="section-desc">
          DOM Level 4 is the current iteration, and it was reassigned from WHATWG to the HTML Working Group, but the new
          recommendations are based off of the WHATWG living standard, this is the standard for the DOM that we still
          use today.

        <hr>
        <p class="section-desc">
          DOM level 1 introduced two key interfaces, the <code class="code-span">document</code> and
          <code class="code-span">element</code>
          interfaces. This allowed scripts to more easily access and alter the structure, style and content of web
          documents. The best way I heard javascript described is a control panel for APIs that access various parts of
          the web browser. We use methods on the <code class="code-span">document</code> and
          <code class="code-span">element</code>
          objects that are exposed by the web browser in order to interact with the DOM plumbing that's written in
          whatever language the browser is written in. In chrome this is done through their Blink engine.

          <code class="code"><i>MacOS:</i> CMD + Option + i</code> If you click on the
          <code class="code-span">Sources</code> tab you can see in the
          <code class="code-span">index.js</code> file I have defined some code for interacting with the webpage by
          switching the color scheme from light to dark, using the sun/moon icon at the top of the page. It also sets
          the theme in
          <code class="code-span">Local Storage</code> and retrieves it if it exists when the page first loads.
          <code class="code-span">Local Storage</code> can be found in the <code class="code-span">Application</code>
          tab of your web browser. This code uses a lot of the APIs that are exposed on the Document object in
          javascript.

          Part of the problem for developers during the browser wars was that cross browser support was painful.
          Accessing
          the dom was not as standardized as it is today, many web browsers had their own baked in methods for doing
          things, and some methods that were available in one browser, was not available in the others. John Resig, the
          inventor of <span class="secondary-content">jQuery</span>, came along and created a library that made it easy
          to write javascript in one browser, and
          have it work in all the others. There were a few other things that jQuery brought to the table.

          The coders in the lab at google in the year 2008 came up with what may well be the biggest contributer to the
          incredible success of the Javascript language, and that is the <span class="secondary-content">V8
            engine</span>. Not only did this greatly improve performance of the language, it also set the stage for
          javascript to be taken seriously as a fullstack programming language, which happened in large part due to the
          (cursed?) invention of <span class="secondary-content">Node.js</span> by Ryan Dahl. Now, you can run
          javascript outside of the web browser. These two combined innovations allowed for the <i

          As web and javascript projects became increasingly large, the need for language features for more well
          developed languages, like type checking, evolved for javascript. Typescript allowed for web apps to be more
          secure, and check for common pitfalls, most of all though it did static typechecking, which prevented the
          common errors that would occur in large javascript applications. Typescript is a superset of javascript, and
          when it is run it is first compiled to javascript, then executed. Typescript was released by Microsoft in
          October, 2012.

          Though the fight to become the web's most used and loved framework is never-ending, the current frontend
          frameworks that stand above the rest of the pack in terms of adoption are the new 2016 version of <span
            class="secondary-content">Angular</span>, and <span class="secondary-content">ReactJS</span>. These two
          separate concerns in a very different way with angular following the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern,
          which directly affects the DOM. Whereas React uses a virtual DOM, that is manipulated and diffed against the
          real DOM, before changes are made. This is 2023 though and the web is changing faster than anyone can keep up
          with, I'm interested (and mildly apprehensive) to see where the web takes us in the next 10 years.
