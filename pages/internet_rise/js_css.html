    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      In fact, it has been a constant source of delight for me over the past year to get to continually tell hordes
      (literally) of people who want to -- strap yourselves in, here it comes -- control what their documents look
      like in ways that would be trivial in TeX, Microsoft Word, and every other common text processing environment:
      "Sorry, you're screwed."
      <BR>

      Sadly, this amazing quote would be quickly undone by another member of CERN. In 1994 HÃ¥kon Wium Lie proposed
      the idea of CSS. It would be proposed and created by Lie and Bert Bos, who had started his own implementation
      before
      deciding to team up with Lie.

      It was first introduced into internet explorer 3 on August, 1996. The first official specification was written
      by Lie and Bos in December of 1996, later that year.

    <H2 class="subtitle">Mocha</H2>
    <P>
      In 1995 one of, if not the most, infamous languagues was written famously in 10 days: <EM>Mocha</EM> or
      <EM>Mochascript</EM>. Netscape 2.0 was pushing for a general purpose programming language to be built into their
      web browser and hired Brendan Eich to write it. <EM>Mochascript</EM> was first shipped as <EM>Livescript</EM> with
      the release of Netscape 2.0 in 1996, but was changed later that year to be called
      <STRONG><EM>Javascript</EM></STRONG>, to make it sound attractive to more developers. Microsoft made a copy called
      <STRONG><EM>JScript</EM></STRONG>(...Is that the best you have MS?).
    </P>
    <P>
      Since the web was wide ranging and diverse,
      it required standardization. The European Computer Manufacturers Association was involved to standardize
      Javascript. This is where you get the specification of Javascript, known officially as ECMAscript.
      Here's the first release of ECMAscript
      <A HREF="https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-262_1st_edition_june_1997.pdf">[2]</A>

      Javascript had the syntax of <STRONG>Java</STRONG>, the prototypal object-orientation of
      <STRONG>Self</STRONG>, and the functional first class function style of the lisp style languague:
      <STRONG>Scheme</STRONG>.

    <H2 class="subtitle">The Document Object Model</H2>
    <P>
      Having a general purpose programming language for the internet is only useful if you can access
      the HTML elements on the page. This is where the Document Object Model (DOM) comes in. A very primative
      DOM was included with Netscape 2.0 and elements on the DOM were accessed by putting Javascript inside "SCRIPT"
      tags.
