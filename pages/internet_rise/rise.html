      "(What) internet hucksters won't tell you is that the internet is one big ocean of unedited data, without any
      pretense of completeness. Lacking editors, reviewers or critics, the Internet has become a wasteland of unfiltered
      data. You don't know what to ignore and what's worth reading."

    <H2>1980 - 1990 - Tim Berners Lee and the Early Internet</H2>
    <P>The World Wide Web began at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland. Tim
      came up with an idea to collaborate with institutions from all over the world. He had an idea to organize and
      pool together imformation, by creating a document in which you could link to the files themselves, this was
      called hypertext. His first hypertext system he named 'Enquire'. The prototype web browser came out 10 years
      later for the NeXT computer. <A TARGET="_blank" HREF='https://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/book4/ch02.html'>[1]</A>
    <P>
      <A TARGET="_blank" HREF='https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser/'>First Web Brower - World Wide Web</A>
    <P>The World Wide Web didn't come out of a vacuum. In 1982 the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) was
      standardized, which allowed for worldwide proliferation of networks. By 1995 A Domain Name System (DNS) was
      established which allowed for assigning Internet Protocol addresses to domain names. In 1986 the National
      Science Foundation Network (NSFNet) provided access to supercomputer sites to download and relay information
      (speeds as high as 56 kbit/s!). Internet service providers emerged in 1989, and Tim Berners Lee was working on
      his web creation during this time. <A TARGET="_blank" HREF='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet'>[2]</A>
    </P>
    <H2>1990 - 1995 - HTML and the HTTP</H2>
    <P>
      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was a protocol written by Tim as a means of fetching and displaying
      Hypertext Markup language (HTML). It functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server model.
      The request in most cases is a GET request, which is in a format defined by the Request For Comment (RFC)
      9110.

    <P>
      The first written HTML was based off of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) <A TARGET="_blank"
        HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language">[3]</A> and contained many of the
      basic tags used in HTML documents. There was no formal HTML definition until 1995 when the HTML 2.0
      specification was formalized by Tim Berners-Lee and Daniel W. Connolly.

      I was surprised to find that HTML 2.0 has quite a lot of functionality and tags that are still commonly used
      all the time in the modern web. This whole page is written using <EM>HTML 2.0 Tags!</EM>
